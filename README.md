# RelativeCopyWebGPT
This repository lets you simply replace the content of a conversation with all the information of a relative or friend
The idea is that on the line that says REPLACE you fill in all the information about the person and
then you are able to run a flask server and a neat little webpage that seems as if you are texting that person in real life
Gpt3.5 16k gives midiocre results in spanish, gpt4 gives acceptable, not tested in english but expected to do well
